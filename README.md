# NumberGuesser

Deployed version: <https://mmbensalah.github.io/number_guesser/>

## Objective

This is the first project for the 4th and last module of the back end program at Turing School of Software & Design. It is an initial exploration into using JavaScript/HTML/CSS and a step away from the previous Ruby on Rails curriculum. A user enters a number range and the game generates a random number within that range for the user to guess.
